\f0\fs22 \cf0 Know how to:\
\
-Draw a domain model\
	-what makes a good/bad one?\
	-Contains:\
		-All the requires classes for the implementation\
		-Real-World conceptual classes\
		-Relationships between the conceptual classes\
		-Classes that the customer would understand \
	-Strategy for finding objects: Analyzing the nouns in the problem description\
-Draw a context diagram\
-Draw a robustness diagram\
-System sequence diagram?\
	-possible to show loops or alternate flows of a scenario\
\
Know:\
\
-Candidate objects\
-Use cases (VERB - NOUN)\
	specify interactions between external actors and the system\
	describe what has to be true for the use case to execute\
	describe key stakeholders and their goals\
-Sprint backlog vs Product Backlog\
	P: shows prioritized tasks or features of the project and how many hours need to be completed or are left for those tasks\
	S: focuses on each group member\'92s individual estimate of how many hours they have to on on and is divided into \'93sprints\'94 or milestones of the project which are typically ~1 week long. In a sprint, each person is assigned a specific task to work on\
-Different types of actors\
	Actor is:\
		-something with behavior, such as a person, computer system, or organization\
		-something outside the system we are building\
	-Primary\
	-Supporting\
	-Offstage\
-SCRUM\
	-Focused mainly on management of software development\
	-Timeboxed iterations - sprints\
	-Project planned through 2 spreadsheets (product and sprint)\
	-Daily meeting (Pigs and Chickens)\
	-Each spring ends with \'93ready\'94 deliverable\
	product backlog contains:\
		-a prioritized list of all the features the application will have\
		-hours left to work on each feature\
		-total hours left to work on the entire project\
	sprint backlog contains:\
		-list of all the tasks that are scheduled for this sprint\
		-the hours left to work on each task\
		-the hours left to work on each task\
-Main Success scenario\
	-First:\
		-Trigger event\
		-Something the external actor does\
		-the thing that kicks off the whole chain of events\
	-Should contain the path which has no exceptional conditions occuring\
	-Should detail the interactions between the User and the System\
